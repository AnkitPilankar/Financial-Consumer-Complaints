For this project, I worked with a dataset of consumer complaints sourced from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), covering a variety of financial products and services. The data included information on complaint submissions, company responses, and resolution statuses such as "closed," "in progress," and "closed with monetary relief." The goal was to analyze trends and performance metrics related to how companies address consumer issues, including response timeliness and resolution effectiveness, while visualizing these insights in an interactive dashboard.
